# movement-simulator [using Spring-Boot and ReactJS]

A simple environment for a robot where we could control it using a predefined script consist of list of commands like:-

POSITION 1 3 EAST "sets the initial position for the robot"

FORWARD 3         "lets the robot do 3 steps forward"

WAIT              "lets the robot do nothing"

TURNAROUND        "lets the robot turn around"

FORWARD 1         "lets the robot do 1 step forward"

RIGHT             "lets the robot turn right"

FORWARD 2         "lets the robot do 2 steps forward"
